Estimate your tasks in this scrum poker planning session

## Aim of this project
This project is meant to be a full open source product. Everything is (and will be) 
documented so everyone can participate and learn from it.

### For everyone
This product must be able to be used by anyone, so the more platforms where it runs, and
the more accessible it is the better.

## Technology
The frontend technology chosen to develop this project is: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

The main reasons to choose Flutter as development frontend framework:
- **Multiplatform framework**. The very first dilemma that I faced as a single developer who
has to build an entire product by himself is how to invest properly my limited time. 
The first idea that came to my mind is: `Write once run everywhere`.
- **Huge community behind**. The community is pretty big, lots of articles, lots of 
questions on stackoverflow. So in case of needing help I know where to look for it.
- **Solid company behind**. Google is actively developing Flutter in the most open-source way
possible. Meanwhile, Google is well-known for abruptly abandoning some of their project 
(I still love Project Tango). However, Flutter is being really well-received by developer
community, and it will be the main framework for building apps in Fuchsia.
